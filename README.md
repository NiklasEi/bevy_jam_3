# Truffle Run

Submission for Bevy Jam #3

A truffle pig looking for truffles ^^

Everything that isn't a truffle is eaten to fill the always depleting hunger bar. Food has a bunch of positive and negative side effects.

ideas for side effects:
- attracting dogs (lose when dogs reach player)
- faster/slower speed (slower might mean losing if there are long jumps... Maybe not a god idea)
- "better nose" (mark truffles?)
